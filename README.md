# North's Elevator
The homepage of NorthWestWind, as an elevator. Made with THREE.js.  
It displays things I have worked on in the past.

## Navigation
Go to https://northwestwind.ml  
To start off, you will want to click on the paper on the right side.  
It should tell you how to use the lift, as well as things on each floor.  
There is also elevator music.

To go to different floors, click on the Up/Down button next to the lift door.  
Once the display shows the floor number you want to go, click on the display.  
Wait for the lift to get there.  
After the doors open, scroll (mouse) or zoom in (touch screen) to move out of the elevator.  
Keep scrolling/zooming in until you reach the limit and text pops up.

## Other Sites
This website also routes to some other things besides the elevator.
