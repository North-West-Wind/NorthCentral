<h2>What's so special?</h2>
<p>
    This mod currently offers 47 different pairs of boots. Each pair has its unique ability like lava-walking, multi-jumping or brewing. 
    It is extremely fun to mess with all these different boots. More updates will come in the future to add more amazing boots!

<h2>You Request, I Create (YRIC)</h2>
<p>
    I like to accept suggestions. You can easily make a request on GitHub, and I will take a look at the ideas. 
    Most of the suggestions will be added if possible. Please note that I might modify some ideas to make them more fitting.
