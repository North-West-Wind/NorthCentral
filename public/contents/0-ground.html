<h1>North's Elevator</h1>
<p>
    Welcome to the most impractical homepage of all time!
    This is an informative website that houses different projects by NorthWestWind, made by NorthWestWind.
</p>
<p>
    Heavily inspired by websites with moving 3D backgrounds. This elevator just takes the idea to the max.
    Each floor of this website is a different thing made by me. Try going to all of them!
    However, the site doesn't show everything I made, as creating one floor takes quite a while.
    If you are interested in looking at my other things, you can browse my <a href="https://github.com/North-West-Wind" target="github">GitHub</a>.
    There is also a very simple <a href="/portal">portal page</a> where you can find all my social links.
    This is made using the WebGL library "THREE.js".
