<h1>N0rthWestW1nd</h1>
<p>
    Dead bot. I don't use Discord anymore.<br>
    By dead, it just means I don't work on it anymore. You can still invite N0rthWestW1nd, but there's a good chance it's broken.
</p>
<p>I'm keeping this for now until I figure out what to do with this floor.</p>
<p>
    The ultimate Discord bot!<br>
    Featuring nearly a hundred of command!<br>
    Made for all purpose!
</p>
<h2>Invite It Right Now!</h2>
