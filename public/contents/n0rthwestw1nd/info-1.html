        <li>What is N0rthWestW1nd?</li>
        <p>
            N0rthWestW1nd is a Discord bot coded by NorthWestWind#1885 with the npm module "discord.js".<br>
            The bot contains a ton of commands. From the basic ones like "role", "kick" and "ban", to gaming APIs like
            "minecraft".<br><br>
            The name of the bot simply comes from the author's name, but replaced "o" to "0" and "i" to "1".
        </p>
        <li>How to use the commands?</li>
        <p>
            Since there are a lot of commands, I wrote a manual to help you out!<br><br>
            To get the manual, take a look at the navigation bar above (or side menu if you are using mobile).<br>
            Then, click "Help". A PDF will be displayed (if your browser supports it).<br><br>
            Some of the commands have their very own subcommands.<br>
            For any question about subcommands, please refer to the manual.

            If you got any new idea about the bot, feel free to put it to the <a href="https://discord.gg/S44PNSh"
                class="text-a">support server</a>!<br>
            I will read them for sure, and they might even get into the bot!
