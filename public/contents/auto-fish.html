<h1>Auto Fish</h1>
<p>
    Auto Fish for Forge is the first mod I've ever made.<br>
    What it does is it allows you to go AFK when fishing without a fishing machine.<br>
    You can download it from <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/autofish-for-forge">CurseForge</a> or view its source code on <a href="https://github.com/North-West-Wind/forge-autofish">GitHub</a>.<br><br>
    Here's a basic showcase:<br>

        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br>
    It also offers some configurations:<br>

<h2>How the Heck?</h2>
<p>
    This mod is actually much simplier than you think. The way it works is it tracks the motion of the fishing bobber. 
    When it reaches certain downward speed, we know it catches something. Then, the mod helps you to automatically retract the fishing rod. How simple!
</p>
<h2>But Why?</h2>
<p>
    To answer that, we need to talk about the 1.16 Nether Update. 
    It's a great update. Everyone loves it. 
    However, they also did one thing that annoys everyone, which is removing fish farms' functionally. 
    I mean, it is not the end of the world. You can still fish the normal way. 
    And that's when the idea clicked. 
    "Let's make a automatic fishing mod," I said to myself, and so I went along and developed it. 
    Now everyone can enjoy AFK fishing!
