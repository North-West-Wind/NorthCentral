<h1>Sky Farm</h1>
<p>
    Sky Farm is the first modpack I've ever created.<br>
    It aims to be in SkyFactory 4 style (which I did not pull off) while still being unique.<br>
    You may download it on <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/sky-farm-1-16">CurseForge</a>.

    This modpack is designed to not be grindy. It uses Mystical Agriculture as a major resource provider and you can spam your crouch button to make them grow.<br>
    It also has Project E, which a lot of modpacks don't like to include.<br>
    Another thing to mention is that, I actually completely re-wrote the Parabox mod in 1.16, and of course it is in the pack. It works a bit differently though.

    Some people may not like this modpack, because it is too focused on the Create mod. This has a reason, actually. 
    Back when I was creating the modpack, no mods like Create provides cool recipes. The results? A lot of recipes require Create. 
    Later in development, Tinker's Construct and some other great 1.12 mods finally updated to 1.16, but it was too late as early game progress is basically done by the time they updated.<br>
    I'm sorry to the people who hates Create, but it probably will not change.
