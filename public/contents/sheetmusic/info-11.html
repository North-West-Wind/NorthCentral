<h1>DK Pass (OST Version)</h1>
<p>
	This is what we call a "High Quality Rip".<br>
	DK Pass (OST Version) is a video uploaded to the SiIvaGunner channel.<br>
	The whole point of that channel is bait-and-switch.<br>
	You thought you're gonna listen to DK Pass? Nope, it's actually the Mario Galaxy 2 Starship theme,
	which by the way, sounds really awesome.<br>
	That's the reason I made this.<br><br>
	I have also been making my own "High Quality Rips". I'll post them after they get published on SiIvaGunner.
