<h1>NewerSMBW Underwater</h1>
<h2>(Newer Super Mario Bros. Wii)</h2>
<p>
    Newer Super Mario Bros. Wii (NewerSMBW) is a romhack of New Super Mario Bros. Wii (NSMBW) developed by the <a href="https://newerteam.com/" target="newer">Newer Team</a>.<br>
    It is an amazing romhack, with custom levels, world maps, power-ups and more! NewerSMBW is still very popular today despite its history of nearly 10 years.<br>
    If you want to get into NSMBW romhacks, you should definitely try this one.<br><br>
    The underwater theme is one of the best soundtracks from the romhack.<br>
    ...I mean all of the soundtracks created are great, but the underwater theme is even better.<br>
    It is the most calming and relaxing soundtrack I have ever listened to. (Except Swing Door Saloon)<br><br>
    The sheet music I created attempts to transfer the feeling to piano.<br>
    It's kind of like a Waltz.<br><br>
    If you would like to listen to all the soundtracks, you can visit the <a href="https://newerteam.com/wii/" target="newerwii">NewerSMBW page</a>.

    If you think the OST is too short and the extended versions are too long, I have a 3-loop version for you.<br><br>
