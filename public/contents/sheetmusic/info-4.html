<h1>Freezeflame Saloon</h1>
<h2>A Swing Door Saloon Remix</h2>
<p>
    If you have seen the Swing Door Saloon (Surviv.io Saloon Music) page, you may have already seen this one.<br>
    This is yet another remix of Swing Door Saloon, but I really love this one so I decided to publish it on Musescore.<br>
    And I'm sorry that this is not for pianos.<br><br>
    This remix is inspired by Newer Super Mario Bros. Wii's Freezeflame Glacier and Volcano world map music, as well as <a href="https://musescore.com/raysontam/12-etudes-op-9-by-rayson-tam" target="freezeflame">12 Etudes, Op. 9, No. 9</a> by Rayson Tam on Musescore.<br>
    If you can't tell, the name of this remix comes from Freezeflame Glacier/Volcano.
