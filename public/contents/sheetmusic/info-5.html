<h1>The Great Sea</h1>
<h2>One of the best from PMTOK</h2>
<p>
    The Great Sea is an area in Paper Mario: The Origami King. You go to there to defeat the Purple Streamer.<br>
    However, I don't think much people have heard this soundtrack, as (I think) it only plays after destroying the Purple Streamer and returning.<br>
    I have been waiting so long for this one. This track is one of the best soundtrack in my opinion.<br>
    It's just like the Saloon Music thing again: I couldn't find it, so I made it myself.
