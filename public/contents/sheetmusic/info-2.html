<h1>Chirp</h1>
<p>
    This is one of the music discs in Minecraft. It is composed by C418, and is part of his Volume Beta.<br>
    Sadly, Microsoft ruins everything (as always).<br>
    C418 does not want Microsoft to own the copyrights to his musics, and Microsoft does not want to use musics they do not own.<br>
    As a result, Minecraft no longer has new C418 tracks.<br><br>
    This sheet music created by me is by no mean to be perfect.<br>
    The bass clef kind of sucks.<br><br>
    You can always find C418's tracks online.
