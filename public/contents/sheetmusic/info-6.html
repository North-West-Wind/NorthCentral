<h1>Mom Hid My Game!</h1>
<h2>Previously known as Hidden My Game By Mom</h2>
<p>
    This sheet music is the main theme of Mom Hid My Game, a game where mom hid your game, and you are going to find it.<br>
	The levels are filled with ridiculous and hilarious things, like having a T-junction in the middle of your house.<br>
	The music goes along with the funny and happy vibes the game offers.<br>
	It is one of the best off-beat fun music I have ever listened to.<br><br>
	So I made a piano sheet out of it.
