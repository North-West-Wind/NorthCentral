<h1>Info Center</h1>

<p>
	"You're in North's Elevator!
	You're currently on floor 1, the Information Center, and I'm here to answer all your questions.
</p>
<p>
	This is a building constructed by NorthWestWind that houses an amount of his projects' information.
	The building is in <span class="highlight">between 2D and 3D space</span>. I call it <span class="highlight">2.5D</span>.
	You are a 3D being, interacting with me, a 2D being.
</p>

<p>
	I don't know how you'd get here without knowing how to operate the elevator, but in case you don't know, I can give you a rundown.
</p>
<p>
	If you are in 3D, exit this conversation, scroll up or zoom out to get back into the elevator.
	On the right side, there are 2 arrow buttons that you can click on to change the selected floor.
	Once you have one selected, click on the floor display to go to that floor.
	To the right corner of your eyes, you should also see a poster. It has the information of which each floor is for. 
</p>
<p>
	If you are in 2D, exit this conversation and you'll be back in the elevator.
	Just like in 3D, use the 2 arrow buttons and the floor display to go to different floors.
	However, as you may see, the poster is missing. To see that, you'll have to go to the ground floor.
</p>

<p>Have fun exploring!"</p>
